## Why

I wanted a new fun project, so I decided to work with the HTML 5 Canvas and revisit Conway's Game of Life. I have been inspired and fascinated with the Game of Life algorithm since I first saw it in college. I still have an ACM magazine from college that talked about it. The complex and mesmerizing patterns that such a simple set of rules create is amazing.


## Goals

* Create a simple and fast implementation of the Game of Life.
* Use ES6 natively without transpiling.
* Use the HTML5 Canvas element.
* Make it fast without overly complicating it.


## Reference

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
* [Stanford](http://web.stanford.edu/~cdebs/GameOfLife/)
* [Cellular Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)


## The Rules

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation. 
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
